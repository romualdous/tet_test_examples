                    The love for the product begins in its user-friendliness. “Does it work?” is not the only question we ask. We also ask, “Which colors makes us app-happy?”, “Is this something humans like to use?” and “Do cats prefer to swipe or scroll?” Imagination is your best friend, and it knows how to use Figma.

                    Abra-cat-abra! In the words of a famous dude - “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” This code you don’t have to pull out of a hat by ears nor saw it in half to understand how it works. The only thing you need to know is that we have computer wizards and they speak binary spells.

                    Indeed here we ask, “Does it run?” until the answer is “Like a hamster in a wheel.” Quality testing is not only about how long does the hamster run, but also – does it always run in the same direction? The product testing master is all about assurance of quality. Catsy cats certified.

Our experienced paws offer business care and a software massage to support the success of even the most badass entrepreneurs.
